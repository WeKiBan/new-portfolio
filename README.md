# React Portfolio

A website to showcase some of my work. Built Using React, React Hooks and MaterialUI.

## Lessons Learned

My second project using the MaterialUI framework. During this project I feel like my knowledge of this framework has improved A lot. I learned how to utilise the theme feature of MaterialUI to share global css variables throughout the project which allows for quicker styling and also makes future changes much easier.

I believe this project has given me a solid grasp of the MaterialUI framework and it is definitely a tool I would consider using in the future to speed up the development of future projects.

## Features

To make the page more visually pleasing I decided to use an animation library called Animate on Scroll which, as the name suggests, fires animations as the user scrolls down the page. I believe this makes the user experience a much more engaging one rather than just static information on the page. I also used another plugin called Tilt which adds a nice animation to the project tile images when the user hovers over them.

For this project I decided to store the data which is displayed on the page in a separate data file which can be easily updated if I need to add new projects or remove old ones.

As I will be applying for Web Development positions in Italy I decided to add the functionality to switch languages between Italian and English using a toggle button in the nav bar as shown below.
